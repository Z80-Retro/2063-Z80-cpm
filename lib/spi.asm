; Write bc bytes from buffer pointed to by hl
; It is assumed that the gpio_out_cache value matches the current state
; of the GP Output port and that SSEL is low.
; This will leave: CLK=0, MOSI=1
;
; Strategy for making a single write function is that small writes are relatively 
; infrequent and can take longer to execute due to overhead, while with large 
; writes (like an SD sector), the overhead is relatively small and transfer is 
; the fastest that it can be.
;
; Inner loop with inlined spi_write8 takes 362** cycles, best case 185344
; cycles for 512 bytes.  Actual 512 byte time longer due to outer loop,
; but the increase is comparatively miniscule (69 more cycles)
; Clobbers: A
; Refactored by Tim Gordon and Trevor Jacobs 06-02-2023 
;
; Unlike the read_str function, there are ALMOST enough registers for the 
; loops in this function.  Instead of using the alternate register set,
; the bc register is pushed onto the stack between bytes to preserve the
; value for the next OUTER loop.  The inner loop stays fast at the expense
; of a slower outer loop (12 cycles per INNER loop versus 21 per outer-
; that's a 12 x 8 = 96 cycle savings at the cost of 21!)
;
; For both the write_str and read_str functions, any set up that makes the 
; inner and outer loops faster is considered *totally* worth it, because 
; those clocks are spent once per string rather than per bit or byte.  Using
; the same logic, the cycle cost of saving and restoring all registers can
; be considered very low whilst making the functions more user friendly.
;
; ** TG 071623 Interrupt page register impact analysis: in the ssel and read 
; functions it was determined that by making sure that CLK "idles" at 0 and 
; MOSI "idles" at 1 at all times, an interrupt that accesses the page bits
; in the gpio_out port would not impact the CLK or MOSI lines.  Here in 
; the write function, an interrupt CAN change the MOSI line inadvertently.
; Thus there is a critical section between when the data pin is set and the 
; rising edge of the clock happens.  Adding di/ei here minimizes the interrupt
; latency but increases the write cycle time by 18%.  By wrapping the whole
; byte in a di/ei pair, the write time is maximized but the worst-case
; interrupt latency becomes 36us.  This is probably the best choice.

; TG 071523 Analysis of impact of interrupted page changes:
; With the "idle" state of CLK and MOSI set to 0 and 1 respectively, this 
; function is free of a critical section that must be protected with a di/ei 
; pair.  An interrupt can only force the pins back to their idle states, and
; this means that this code is the only code creating a rising edge on CLK.
; Thus no critical section protection need be implemented.

; This function is special because SSEL is changed and the 
; gpio_out_cache value needs to remember the new state.  All
; other functions explicitly set the MOSI and CLK so the
; cached copy doesn't need to constantly "remember" their 
; states.
;
; The read8 at the beginning of the function (while SSEL is 
; inactive) reflects state of original code so is left in.
; 
; The read8 loop after asserting SSEL makes sure that a write 
; left "in progress" is completed before a new command is started.
; If there is no write in progress, the sd card should leave 
; the bus floating and the loop will exit immediately.  Extra
; clocks in groups of 8 never hurt anyone (outside of write
; data transfers!)
;
; TG 071523 Analysis of issues caused by interrupt-driven page
; changes results in need to "protect" the coherency of the 
; gpio_out_cache and port pins by wrapping the critical
; section in a di/ei pair.
; If not protected, a page change triggered by an interrupt
; could cause the SSEL line to revert to its entry state, 
; which will definetly cause a problem.  
; Since adopting the "idle" state of CLK = 0 and MOSI = 1,
; there is no longer a chance of an extra rising CLK edge 
; as the cached value will always have a low clock state.  The
; same goes for MOSI; it would always be driven to its idle 
; state.
; In fact, by ordering the cache write and the port write as
; below, interrupts do not need to be disabled because the 
; ISR will read the cached value and "pre"-write it out.
; If the cache write was after the port write, an ISR would
; write the previous value.
;
; The de register is pushed upon entry becaue the disk boot 
; function in firmware.asm assumes that it is retained.

; There is no loop counter or indication of failure of a 
; previous operation in the wait for not busy loop.
