## How to Clone This Repo

Since incorporating the use of submodules, the process of 'getting everything' requires a command that will recursively download all of the parts like this:

	git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Z80-Retro/2063-Z80-cpm.git

or, if you use ssh (useful if you want to push changes to a repo to make a pull request):

	git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Z80-Retro/2063-Z80-cpm.git


## How to Avoid Spoilers!

Starting on 20220304 you can avoid any spoilers while watching my 
[YouTube video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3by7evD3F51Cf9QnsAEdgSQ4cz7HQZX5) that discusses this project by clicking on the 
Releases/tags link in github and locate the tag that matches the datecode
in each video. (Specifically the datecode *in* the video itself, not the
dates that YouTube posts about when the videos are uploaded etc.)

Note that I use datacodes that look like this: YYYYMMDD.n 

Sorry I did not think of this before.

## SD Card Preparation

A discussion of how to partition an SD card for the Retro! board can be found in [./README-SD.md](./README-SD.md)

## Boot a Hello World! app from the SD card

See the code in [./hello](./hello) to create a program that will load and run from the SD card.

## Where to download CP/M 

After the clarification of the Digital Research Inc. license in 2022 on the use and distribution of CP/M, all of the files needed to build and run CP/M on the Retro have been made available on github in the [Z80-Retro/cpm-2.2](https://github.com/Z80-Retro/cpm-2.2) repo.

The CP/M source, utilities, and manuals were collected from the [The Unofficial CP/M Web site](http://www.cpm.z80.de/) in 2023:
- [source code](http://www.cpm.z80.de/source.html) of various CP/M releases:
  - I used the link that says: [CP/M 2,2 ASM SOURCE code](http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/cpm2-asm.zip)
- Application program [binaries](http://www.cpm.z80.de/binary.html) that can run on the Retro!
  - I used the link that says: [CP/M 2.2 BINARY](http://www.cpm.z80.de/download/cpm22-b.zip) distribution disk for the Xerox 1800 system


## Build and install CP/M

See [./retro](./retro) for details on assembling and installing CP/M onto an SD card.
