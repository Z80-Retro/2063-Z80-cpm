# Build a filesystem from the cpm-2.2 distro files, retro.asm BIOS, and some
# sample downloads like adventure.

# To create an image with CP/M distro plus adventure:
# make drive.img
#
# To erase an SD card to prepare it for use:
# make blank-all-sd
#
# To copy the CP/M files onto drive A:
# make burn
#
#
# This is where the adventure game files came from:
# wget -P adventure https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/cpm/cpm-advent.zip 
#
# To list the files that are in the created image:
# make ls

# Put the 'all' target first so that it is THE default target.
# The :: means that more than one of the same target name is same as one big one.
